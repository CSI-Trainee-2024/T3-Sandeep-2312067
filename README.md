Hey Viewer this is my third website and 1st game website.

This is the Mineswepper game website in this website there are 25 boxes in which there is 5 mines and these are arranged randomly and other are gems 
that are arranged at other blank boxes.
If user click on gem box then score is increases by one and gives sound of cooins.
If user click on bomb box then game over and gives bom blast sound and that is the final score.
As you click on bomb box then all gems are show with lesser opacity than bomb.
